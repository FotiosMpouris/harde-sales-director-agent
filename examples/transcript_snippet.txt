Rep: Hey Hard-E, I’m heading to 42 Yarmouth Place tomorrow. It’s a two-story colonial, homeowner is interested in fiber cement siding and potentially new trim.

Hard-E: Got it. What’s the main concern they mentioned so far?

Rep: They’re worried about long-term maintenance and whether the higher upfront cost makes sense compared to vinyl.

Hard-E: Understood. Do you want help practicing the pitch, or should I generate a primer video script you can send in advance?

Rep: Let’s do both. First, help me practice the pitch, then give me a short video script I can send tonight.
